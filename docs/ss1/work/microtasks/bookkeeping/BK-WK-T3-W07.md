# BK-WK-T3-W07 — Bookkeeping, 3rd Term, Week 7 indexing

Status: **IMPLEMENTED_TESTING_DEFERRED**. Objective-level source indexing only; no teaching text or missing worked answers are invented.

## Source identity and boundary
- Source: `SS1-SRC-97f226215927`; member SHA-256 `343c428b86364be8e1784c814fdd7ca3d02836f508e7eff289af0e139447fd7d`.
- Scheme locator: scheme blocks 24–27; body blocks 394–417.
- Inventory: `BK-INV-T3.md`.
- The source has no literal WEEK marker in the teaching body. This is a scheme-week mapping, not a verified importer row or confirmed body boundary.

## Objectives and evidence

| Scheme objective | Status | Source evidence and gap |
|---|---|---|
| Definition of trading account | PARTIAL | Block 402 defines trading account and gross profit; no standalone trading-account layout or solved example is present. |
| Description of cost of goods sold | PARTIAL | Blocks 410–413 define goods available for sale and cost of goods sold; no complete numerical illustration is supplied. |
| Determining gross profit | PARTIAL | Block 416 defines gross profit; no complete trading-account calculation demonstrates it. |

## Implementation boundary
- Matching `coverage[]` entries are recorded in `backend/src/db/ss1/subjects/bookkeeping.json` with exact source locators, evidence, and no lesson IDs.
- PARTIAL/UNRESOLVED statuses deliberately block delivery until a teaching lesson or separately authored equivalent exists.
- No source wording, figures or dates are silently corrected. See `BK-PRES-T3-WORKED` for arithmetic review and `BK-INV-T3.md` for source structure.
- Importer/compiler execution, package tests and delivery verification remain deferred.
